I took the feedback from my previous portfolio assignment and applied it to my improved portfolio. Though maybe not 100% there - this website is more responsive and well designed than the previous. I was able to utilize CSS libraries to help with the layout. I also worked on improving the semantic html to assist the screen reader to interpret my site to better serve users with vision impairments.

I will continue to improve my portfolio. I know I have too many media queries. I think I had an issue with competeing styles in the CSS library vs. my own styling on my nav bar, causing me to need more media queries. At this point I just want to get the site working, and then I can explore ways to make it function better with less code.

**Website Behavior**<br>
When the links in the navbar are clicked, the user is taken to those sections of the website. When the user clicks the 'Resume' link, they are taken to a pdf of my resume. The project images are linked, as well as the project title. When these links are clicked, the user is taken to the application page in a separate tab. The github repos are also linked.

In the footer, my LinkedIn and Github profiles are linked, as well as my email and phone number.
